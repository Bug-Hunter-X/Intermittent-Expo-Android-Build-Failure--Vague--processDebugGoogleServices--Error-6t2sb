# Intermittent Expo Android Build Failure: Vague 'processDebugGoogleServices' Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process fails with a generic error message, lacking specific details for effective debugging. This issue is intermittent and affects only certain projects.

## Bug Description

The Expo Android build process unexpectedly fails with an error similar to `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'.` The error message does not provide sufficient information to pinpoint the cause. The problem seems related to issues with the Google Services JSON file, configuration conflicts, or corrupted files.  The bug is sporadic and has been observed in projects that previously built successfully without code changes.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing this bug is challenging due to its intermittent nature. The following steps may help:

1. Create a new Expo project.
2. Add Firebase or other Google services (this may trigger the issue). 
3. Attempt to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`.

## Solution

This repository provides a potential solution to the problem. This solution isn't guaranteed to work in all cases as the root cause is elusive.

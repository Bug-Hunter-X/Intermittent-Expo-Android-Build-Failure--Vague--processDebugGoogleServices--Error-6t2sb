This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message similar to: `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`.  The error does not provide specific details about the problem, making it difficult to diagnose.  The issue seems to stem from a conflict or incompatibility between the Google Services JSON file and the Expo build process, or a missing or corrupted configuration file.  This bug is intermittent and only affects certain projects, making reproduction difficult.  The project may have previously built successfully and then started failing without any apparent code changes.  Cleaning the project cache or rebuilding the project does not solve the issue consistently.

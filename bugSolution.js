The root cause of this error is often difficult to pinpoint due to its vague nature.  However, here are some steps that may resolve the issue:

1. **Check Google Services JSON:** Ensure your `google-services.json` file is correctly configured and placed in the `android/app` directory of your Expo project. Double-check that the package name in this file matches the package name in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. **Clean the project:** Try cleaning the project's build cache. In the terminal, navigate to your project's directory and run `./gradlew clean` (for Linux/macOS) or `gradlew.bat clean` (for Windows).  Then, try building again.
3. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio (if applicable). 
4. **Update Dependencies:** Update your Expo and related dependencies to their latest versions using `expo upgrade` and check for any conflicts.
5. **Check Gradle Version:** Ensure you have a compatible version of Gradle. Check Expo documentation for recommendations. 
6. **Create a new project:** If none of the above works, consider creating a fresh Expo project and slowly migrating your code to see if you can isolate the problematic part of your application.
7. **Verify SHA-1 Fingerprint:** Ensure that the SHA-1 fingerprint registered in your Firebase project (or other Google service) matches the one generated for your debug and release keystores.
